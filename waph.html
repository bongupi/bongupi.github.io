            <strong>LAB-1:</strong>
            In this lab, we explored the world of computer communication through protocols, with a focus on HTTP. Using Wireshark, we observed the detailed conversations between computers, specifically looking at HTTP requests and responses facilitated by telnet. Moving forward, we delved into web application programming, creating CGI scripts in C, HTML, and PHP. Deploying these scripts allowed us to access dynamic web pages through browsers. Wireshark remained a valuable tool for analyzing the specifics of HTTP GET and POST requests, offering insights into the communication flow between clients and servers. Overall, this lab provided a hands-on experience in understanding both protocol dynamics and the practical aspects of web application development.

        <strong>LAB-2:</strong>
n this lab, I learned how to build webpages. I used HTML for structure, adding images and forms. Then, I learned JavaScript for interactivity, including how to embed it in HTML. CSS helped me style the page, while Ajax made data loading smoother. Finally, I explored jQuery for easier webpage manipulation. These basics set me up for creating my own websites.    </div>

      <strong>HACKATHON:</strong>  
      During the initial phase of our hackathon, I explored various levels of reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, starting from basic JavaScript alerts in input fields to more complex methods like manipulating URLs and evading server-side sanitization. Each level presented unique challenges, requiring a deep understanding of vulnerabilities to enhance future web application security.

Moving forward, I'm actively strengthening our code against potential threats. This involves implementing strict input validation and accurate data encoding in the echo.php file from Lab 1. Additionally, while developing our front-end prototype in Lab 2, I'm carefully validating and sanitizing all external data sources before displaying them on the webpage.

          <strong>INDIVIDUAL PROJECT-1:</strong>
          In crafting my professional website on GitHub, I prioritized both aesthetics and functionality. Leveraging Bootstrap ensured a visually appealing and responsive design across various devices, while additional features like real-time weather updates and jokes fetched from APIs added an interactive touch, showcasing my proficiency in integrating external data. Technically, I employed React components for content organization, coupled with JavaScript and jQuery for interactive elements, ensuring seamless API integration for data display. This comprehensive approach not only tells my professional story but also highlights my expertise in web development and design. Moreover, by incorporating the Joke and Weatherbit APIs, I enhanced the site's engagement and utility, illustrating my versatility and commitment to delivering exceptional digital experiences.
